# Password-Generator

## Description

This project is a password generator. 

I built this project because I wanted to create a tool that would help people generate strong passwords. Strong passwords are important because they can help protect your accounts from being hacked.
This project solves the difficulty of creating strong passwords. Strong passwords are difficult to come up with on the spot, and they can be difficult to type. This project makes it easy to create strong passwords that are ready to be copied and pasted. This is my first project that had practical use. I learned about functions, variables, loops, and conditional statements and how the all function together to get a working product.
